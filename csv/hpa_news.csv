2025-09-23,HPA News,Industry News,Q&A with Craig Dolan – Reflecting on his time as HPA Chair,"The most significant change I’ve seen whilst I’ve been in the role is the proactive engagement from Government. Before, there seemed to be some underlying mistrust of heat pumps, even though they are in no way a new technology. Now, there seems to be a lot more positivity and pragmatism. We’ve seen this in the HPA with our sales figures, which saw just under 100,000 heat pumps sold to the UK market in 2024 and which we update DESNZ on  monthly. There’s been a definite change in tone and cadence to the meetings we have with officials now, and it feels like the tide has turned from how can we avoid making this change to how can we make this happen.",https://www.heatpumps.org.uk/qa-with-craig-dolan-reflecting-on-his-time-as-hpa-chair/
